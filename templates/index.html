<h1 class="title">What is PicoShare?</h1>

<p>PicoShare is a service for sharing images, videos, and other files.</p>

<p>
  On PicoShare, only <i>you</i> can upload files. You can share links to those
  files with anyone, and they never have to sign up for an account.
</p>

<p>PicoShare puts you fully in control, which means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Guests can download your files without seeing ads or prompts to sign up for
    an account.
  </li>
  <li>
    PicoShare never resizes or re-encodes your media files.
  </li>
  <li>
    PicoShare preserves the original filename and metadata for your files.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>PicoShare is easy to self-host. See our
  <a href="https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare">source repo</a> for details.
