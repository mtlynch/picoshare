# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in PicoShare!

This document is meant to help developers get up to speed on PicoShare so that they can start development with as little frustration as possible.

## Setting up a development environment

The steps below show you how to quickly set up a development environment for PicoShare.

### Requirements

- Golang 1.17 or higher
- Node.js 16.x or higher

### Install prettier

PicoShare uses the Prettier npm package to verify consistent formatting.

```bash
npm install
```

### Run automated tests

To run PicoShare's build scripts before making a PR, run:

```bash
dev-scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit
```

### Enable Git hooks

If you're planning to contribute code to PicoShare, it's a good idea to enable the standard Git hooks so that build scripts run before you commit. That way, you can see if basic tests pass in a few seconds rather than waiting a few minutes to watch them run in CircleCI.

```bash
./dev-scripts/enable-git-hooks
```

### Run in dev mode

To run PicoShare locally with hot-reloading, run:

```bash
./dev-scripts/serve-dev
```

The default password is `somepassword`.

## Code style conventions

PicoShare follows Google code style conventions:

- [HTML/CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
- [Shell](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)

PicoShare uses automated linters and formatters as much as possible to automate style conventions.

### Formatting Golang

```bash
go fmt ./...
```

### Formatting JavaScript/HTML/CSS

```bash
npm run format
```

## Proposing changes

- If you're making a small change, submit a PR to show your proposal.
- If you're making a large change (over 100 LOC or three hours of dev time), [file an issue](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/issues/new/choose) first to talk through the proposed change. This prevents you from wasting time on a change that has a low chance of being accepted.

## How to get your PR merged quickly

- Read my guide, ["How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You,"](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/) to understand how to contribute effectively to an open source project.
- Give a clear, one-line title to your PR.
  - Good: `Fix dropped keystrokes on Firefox`
  - Bad: `Fix issue`
- If your PR is not ready for review, mark it as "draft."
- [Rebase your changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) onto the latest `master` commit so that there are no merge conflicts.
- Your PR must pass build checks in CI before it will be considered for merge.
  - You'll see a green checkmark or red X next to your PR depending on whether your build passed or failed.
  - You are responsible for fixing formatting and tests to ensure that your code passes build checks in CI.

I try to review all PRs within one business day. If you've been waiting longer than this, feel free to comment on the PR to verify that it's on my radar.
