### why serve Picoshare with Traefik?

In Picoshare, it handles HTTP(S) traffic, and manages SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt, ensuring secure connections. This simplifies deployment by automating routing and SSL setup.

**Create `acme.json` file**:

- Before starting the services, create an empty `acme.json` file in `/opt/traefik/` with proper permissions (`chmod 600 acme.json`). This file will store the SSL certificates.

### Docker Compose

- The `docker-compose.yml` file already includes the required services for Traefik and Picoshare, with proper labels for routing and SSL.

```bash
# Docker Compose Command to Run Picoshare with Traefik
 docker-compose up -d
```
